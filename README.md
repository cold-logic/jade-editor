## About
This is a real-time browser based editor for web UI/UX with four inputs:
* jade
* css
* json (fed into jade)
* javascript (executed on document load)

Changes are reflected real-time in the iframe on the right.

This project is largely experimental and there is a lot of stuff in it that isn't even used.
